            <p>The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth. It is located at an average distance of 384,400 km from the Earth. The angle of inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5° 8' 43". The mass is 7.35×1022 kg (1/81.3 the mass of the Earth). The average radius is 1738 km, the acceleration of free fall on the surface is 1.62 m/s2. Astronomical sign ☾. The Moon's orbit lies at an average angle of 5°8'43" to the ecliptic plane, varying from 4°58' to 5°20'. The period during which the Moon moves from west to east around the Earth and makes a complete revolution relative to a star is called its sidereal (or sidereal) period. This period is equal to 27.32 average solar days. The points of intersection of the Moon's orbit with the ecliptic plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The Moon's nodes move along the ecliptic in the opposite direction to the Moon's motion (ie, westward) and make one full revolution of the ecliptic in 18 years and 7 months (6793 days). The time elapsed between the moon leaving a node and returning to this node is called a dragon month, and it is equal to 27.21222 days on average. The periodicity of solar and lunar eclipses is related to this month. <br><br><br>

                The moon rotates around an axis that makes an average angle of 83°20' with its orbit. Its rotation period around its axis (27.32 days) is equal to the sidereal moon (period), so the Moon always "looks" at the Earth from one side. It is no coincidence that these periods have remained the same. The Earth's gravity affects (slows down) the Moon's rotation around its axis, making it equal to the period of its rotation around the Earth for millions of years. <br><br>
                
                While the Moon rotates flat on its axis, its speed varies at different points in its orbit around the Earth, as a result of which the Moon appears to move slightly oscillating from Earth. The inclination is 7°54' in longitude and 6°50' in latitude. This vibration is called libration.</p>
